üéØ OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP FOR 90%+ ACCURACY
=============================================

Based on validation results showing 79.83% accuracy with excellent Normal (91.4%) 
but poor minority class performance, here's the roadmap to deployment-ready accuracy.

CURRENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
- Normal (N): 91.4% ‚úÖ Excellent
- Ventricular (V): 30.5% ‚ùå Needs major improvement  
- Supraventricular (S): 25.3% ‚ùå Needs major improvement
- Fusion (F): 24.6% ‚ùå Needs major improvement
- Unknown (Q): 42.8% ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate
